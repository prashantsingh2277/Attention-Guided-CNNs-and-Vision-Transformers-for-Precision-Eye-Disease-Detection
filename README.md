# Attention-Guided-CNNs-and-Vision-Transformers-for-Precision-Eye-Disease-Detection
This approach combines CNNs, Attention-guided CNNs, and Vision Transformers (ViTs) for precise eye disease detection from retinal images. An Attention-guided CNN extracts disease-specific features, which fine-tune a Vision Transformer for classification. This process results in highly accurate and robust disease detection.
